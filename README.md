Machine Learning model that predicts the presence of Diabetes given statistics about personal health. 

The model's accuracy is 79% currently, and HTML/CSS were used in implementing a Flask Application UI for aesthetic
and usability.

To use application, run app.py, with project structure:

UIdirectoryfolder/app.py

UIdirectoryfolder/model.pkl

UIdirectoryfolder/scaler.pkl

UIdirectoryfolder/templates/index.html

UIdirectoryfolder/templates/result.html

UIdirectoryfolder/static/css/styles.css


Model in main.py is located outside of the UI directory folder.
