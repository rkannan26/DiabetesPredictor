Machine Learning model that predicts the presence of Diabetes given statistics about personal health. 

Preliminary Data Analysis is performed in Analysis.py, revealing 4 plots about variable relationships. 

The model's accuracy is 79% currently, and HTML/CSS were used in implementing a Flask Application UI for aesthetic
and usability.

To use application, run app.py, with project structure (Model in main.py is located outside of the UI directory folder):

UIdirectoryfolder/app.py

UIdirectoryfolder/model.pkl

UIdirectoryfolder/scaler.pkl

UIdirectoryfolder/templates/index.html

UIdirectoryfolder/templates/result.html
