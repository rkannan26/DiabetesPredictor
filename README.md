The model's accuracy is 79% currently, and HTML/CSS were used in implementing a Flask Application UI for aesthetic
and usability.

To use application, run app.py, with project structure:

UIdirectoryfolder/

│
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│       ├── styles.css
│
├── app.py
├── model.pkl
└── scaler.pkl


Model in main.py is located outside of the UI directory folder.
